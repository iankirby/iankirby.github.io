# Resources

This repository houses a few things I have created or compiled for my own purposes that I thought others might also find useful.  You can contact me at ian@ilkirby.com for feedback, issues, or suggestions.

## Latex

- [fixBib.pl](fixBib/fixbib.md), a Perl script that replaces `title={`...`},` with `title={{`...`}}` (for capitalization in book and article titles).
<!-- - [texSpacing.py](texSpacing/texspacing.md), a Python script that makes sure linguex, figures, tables, and align environments are single spaced in an otherwise non-single spaced environment. -->

## Wiktionary tools (in progress)
