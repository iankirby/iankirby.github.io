    <p> people have persnickety opinions about they way they want their documents to be rendered, the color schemes that they like.  </p>

    <p>If you've ever worked late into the night at a computer, you've probably had the impression that your computer is just too bright. </p>
    

    Look. I like dark mode.  I hate screen mode.  .  I couldn't care less whether you use a serif or sans-serif font.    I like including color in my documents as well.  Different people have different tastes
